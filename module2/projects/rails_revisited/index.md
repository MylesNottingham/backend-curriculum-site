title: ðŸš† Rails, Revisited
---

## Learning Goals

* Refactor an existing codebase and bring all existing features & tests up to quality expectations for the end of module 2. 
* Design a one-to-many relationship using a schema designer.
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms & any applicable View Helpers (`form_with`, `button_to`, etc.)
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, restricting logic to its respective responsibility areas (view logic in views, data logic in models, etc)
* Use querying skills (SQL & AR) effectively to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes. 

## Requirements

- Must use Rails 5.2.x
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Must deploy completed application to Heroku
- Must have 100% coverage in both feature & mdoel tests, including model validations and sad path testing. 
- Must include a README with the project, including a description of the base app and high-level details of the refactoring process (a "change log"). 

## Permission

- If there is a specific gem you'd like to use in this project that is not mentioned on this project page, you must get permission from your instructors first.

## Setup
Students should retain their original **Relational Rails** application, but **fork** their old repository for work in this project. Inside that fork, students should create a new README file that details the changes they make as per the requirements of this project. 

## Evaluation
Rubric and evaluation instructions can be found [here](./evaluation).

---
 

## Refactoring
To begin, explore your first version of Relational Rails. You've learned a lot since then! Make a list of what needs updating or changing in order to reflect the knowledge that you have now, including but not limited to: 
* Routes should be using `resources` syntax, no hand-rolled routes
* Forms should be using `form_with @model` syntax
* Any MVC violations (data logic in views or controllers, Ruby in querying methods, etc.)
* Testing should be at 100% for both features and models before starting any new user stories. 

As each refactor is made, document the changes in your README file as part of your changelog. 

## Database Setup 
Looking at your original Parent-Child relationship, design an additional 3rd Model that can relate to your Parent-Child in a `many_to_many` fashion. 

<section class="call-to-action">
   <h3>Example</h3>
   <p><strong>Shelters</strong> have many <strong>Pets</strong>, and <strong>Pets</strong> belong to a <strong>Shelter</strong>.</p>
   <p><strong>Owners</strong> have many <strong>Pets</strong>, and <strong>Pets</strong> have many <strong>Owners</strong>.</p>
</section>

![Pets Shelters and Owners](./revisited_db_diagram.png)

Your additional Model should include the following datatypes:
  - Primary key (ID, integer)
  - Name (string)
  - Number, integer or float (primary key does not count)
  - Boolean
  - You can include additional columns if needed, but should include these at minimum.


Reminder: *You should not create columns that duplicate data.* For example, in Pets/Shelters, a Shelter should not store a "pet_count" column since the count of Pets can also be found by counting the number of associated pets.

Before continuing, ensure your new Model is 100% tested, including validations and relationships to existing models.

## User Stories
Note: `Tertiary` in these user stories refers to the new 3rd model you created above. 

```
1. Tertiary Index

When I visit my Parent Show Page
Then I see a link to view all my Tertiary instances
When I click this link, then I am taken to my Tertiary Index Page (/parents/:id/tertiaries) 
Where I see all of my Tertiaries including all their attributes 
And each object listed includes a link to its show page.

Example: 
URL: /shelters/:id/owners
- John Smith (link to /owners/:id)
   Address: 123 Main St. 
   Age: 52
   Used coupon: false

- Jane Doe (link to /owners/:id)
